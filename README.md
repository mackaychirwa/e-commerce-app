## Setup Instructions

### Backend Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   Navigate to the `backend` folder and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure Database**:
   In the `src/config/database.js` file, set up your database connection details.

3. **Running Migrations & Seeder**:
   After setting up the database configuration, run the migrations and seeders to initialize the database.
   ```bash
   npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
   npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all
   ```

4. **Start the Backend Server**:
   After migrating the database, you can start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   Navigate to the `frontend` folder and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the Frontend**:
   Start the frontend application:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Running Migrations & Seeder

To run migrations and seeders for the backend, follow these commands:

1. **Run Migrations**:
   ```bash
   npx sequelize-cli db:migrate
   ```

2. **Run Seeder**:
   ```bash
   npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all
   ```

This will set up the necessary database schema and populate the database with default data, including the default admin user.

---

## Default Credentials

After running the migrations and seeders, the default user will be created.

- **Username**: `admin@tushop.com`
- **Password**: `password`

Use these credentials to log in as an admin.

---

## Endpoints

Here are some of the key API endpoints available in the system:

- **API Documentation**:
  - `GET /api-docs`: API Documentation

For more details, refer to the `routes` folder.
